# MP1-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of Machine Project 1, Transformations, for the spring 2018 semester of CS 125, Introduction to Computer Science, at the University of Illinois.
The purpose of this project was to work with very basic data transformations. The transformations were obtaining the lines of an actor/actress from an array and encrypting and decrypting strings the Ceasar cypher.
Code which I (Andrew Kim) worked on are marked by comments that begin with "put down places where the encrypt fails, entered emails, and started the shift."
